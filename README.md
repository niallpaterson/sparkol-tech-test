# Authentication tech test

The react is built with React. To use the app the authentication API must be run locally. If you do not already have the API, clone down the repository:

````shell
git clone https://github.com/Sparkol/interview-authentication-service.git
````

then navigate into the directory, install any packages, and start the api:

````shell
cd interview-authentication-service
npm install
npm start
````

There are two options for using the solution app. The easiest way is to visit the [hosted version](https://niallpaterson.github.io/sparkol-tech-test/). Alternatively, the app can be downloaded and run locally. To do so, clone down the repository:

````shell
git clone https://github.com/niallpaterson/sparkol-tech-test.git
````

Then navigate into the directory and install any missing packages *with yarn*:

````shell
cd sparkol-tech-test
yarn install
````

Run the app in a development environment by using:

````shell
yarn start
````

If the API is running locally, you should be able to login, see a personalised message, and logout as per the specs.
